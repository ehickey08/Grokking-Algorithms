# Binary Search
- Only works on sorted arrays
- O(log n) runtime complexity

# Big O Notation
- Measures how well an algorithm grows/scales
- Don't measure algorithms in seconds but rather how many operations


# Exercises
1.1: 7 steps
1.2: 8 steps
1.3: O(log n) using binary search
1.4: O(n) using linear search
1.5: O(n)
1.6: O(n) as they could all be A's
